Why we need Lambda in Java:
 
   Problem
	>> Parallel Processing to improve application 
performance is not there.

so in Java 1.8, they introduced Lambda, Streams, 
functional interface


Lambda Expression: its a Anonymous function
 >> No method name
 >> Parameters
 >> Method Body (Multiple statement)
 >> Return types

Syntax:

(parameters) -> Expression

(parameters) -> {... Multiple statements}

Note: lambda needs Functional Interface
