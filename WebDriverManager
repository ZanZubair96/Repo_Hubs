#WebDriverManager

*Official:*
1.	It checks the version of the browser installed in your machine (e.g. Chrome, Firefox).
2.	It matches the version of the driver (e.g. chromedriver, geckodriver). If unknown, it uses the latest version of the driver.
3.	It downloads the driver if it is not present on the WebDriverManager cache (~/.cache/selenium by default).
4.	It exports the proper WebDriver Java environment variables required by Selenium (not done when using WebDriverManager from the CLI or as a Server).

*Resolution algorithm:*
To resolve the driver version for a given browser, first WebDriverManager try to find out the version of that browser. This mechanism depends on the browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc) and the platform (Linux, Windows, Mac). For instance, for Chrome in Linux, the command google-chrome --version is executed in the shell. The commands used by WebDriverManager are stored in a properties file called commands.properties.

Then, WebDriverManager tries to determine which is the proper driver version for the detected browser version. To that aim, first the values of LATEST_RELEASE labels within the driver repositories are read. Besides, WebDriverManager maintains a properties file called versions.properties which maps the proper driver and browsers versions. To use always the latest relationships between browser and driver, the online version of versions.properties (master branch) is used. As alternative, the local version of this file (distributed within WebDriverManager) is used.

The relationship between the resolved browser and driver version is stored in a internal file called resolution cache. As of WebDriverManager 4.0.0, this database is stored in a properties file called resolution.properties located by default in the cache folder (~/.cache/selenium). The validity of this relationship (browser version and driver version) is limited by a time-to-live (TTL) value. There are two kinds of TTLs. First, a TTL for driver versions, with a default value of 86400 seconds (i.e. 1 day). Second, a TTL for browser versions, with a default value of 3600 seconds (i.e. 1 hour).
